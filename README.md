###### About

A one-instruction set computer (OISC) is an abstract machine whose processor can only perform one operation. With a judicious choice for the single instruction (and infinite resources,) an OISC is capable of being a universal computer in the same manner as traditional computers that have multiple instructions.

`SUBLEQ`, "*sub*tract and branch if *l*ess than or *eq*ual to zero," is one such instruction.
